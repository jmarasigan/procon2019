  <h3>DESIGNED TO GIVE YOU THE RIDE OF YOUR LIFE</h3>
  <div>
    <img src="./images/cwc1.jpg">
    <img src="./images/cwc2.jpg">
    <p>
    The Camsur Watersports Comlex is the first world-class watersports complex in the Philippines and in Asia. CWC aims to bring cable skiing to a whole new level and attract watersports enthusiasts from all over the world with its top of the line facilities and relaxing environment. This six (6)-hectare complex, with its 6-point cable ski system, is sure to draw guests, riders and spectators by the thousands. Because of good weather conditions, cable skiing in the park can be done all year round.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>WHERE TO RIDE THE CABLE</h3>
  <div>
    <img src="./images/cwc3.jpg">
    <img src="./images/cwc4.jpg">
    <p>
    The CAMSUR WATERSPORTS COMPLEX is located within the Provincial Capitol Complex, Cadlan, Pili, Camarines Sur. The province of Camarines Sur, situated in southeastern part of Luzon is found in the Philippines, Southeast Asia.
    From Asia, Europe or the USA, fly to Manila, Philippines (NAIA or CENTENNIAL 2 Airports) and take a 35 minute domestic flight via Philippine Airlines to Naga Airport, Pili. The CAMSUR WATERSPORTS COMPLEX is a 3-minute or 1.5 kilometer drive from the Naga Airport. If you’re up for a road trip, air-conditioned and ordinary buses ply the 8-hour route daily to and from Manila
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>RIDE ON WATER</h3>
  <div>
    <img src="./images/cwc5.jpg">
    <img src="./images/cwc6.jpg">
    <p>
   Cable skiing is simply water-skiing where the skier is pulled by an overhead cable suspended 8-12 meters above water surface by specifically designed pylons. The cables run counter clockwise around the lake. It is powered by a variable speed electric motor which can maintain speeds between 20 - 65 km/h.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>WAKEBOARDING</h3>
  <div>
  	<img src="./images/cwc7.jpg">
    <p>
    Wakeboarding was created from a combination of water skiing, snow boarding and surfing techniques. Instead of using skis, the rider rides a single board with stationary non-release bindings for each foot, standing sideways. Wakeboarding, besides being one of the world’s fastest growing sports and is gradually being recognized globally, has become a lifestyle for others.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>KNEEBOARDING</h3>
  <div>
    <img src="./images/cwc8.jpg">
    <p>
    Kneeboarding is an aquatic sport where the participant is towed on a buoyant, convex, and hydrodynamically-shaped board at a planing speed behind a motorboat or cable. In the usual configuration of a towsport kneeboard, the rider sits on his heels on the board, and secures himself to the deck with an adjustable strap. As in wakeboarding or water skiing, the rider hangs onto a tow-rope. The forte of kneeboarding vis-à-vis other towsports seems to be an easier learning curve, and not requiring as much effort to have fun.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>WATERSKIING</h3>
  <div>
  	<img src="./images/cwc9.jpg">
    <p>
    Water skiing is a sport where the rider is pulled along by a rope with a handle fitted at one end and the other attached to a powerboat. Within the confines of being pulled along by the boat or cable, skiers can control their direction by balancing their weight on different sides of their ski. This is used to zip back and forth behind the boat. Recreational skiers usually learn to ski with a ski on each foot, but as they improve, they progress to using a single ski, placing the other foot into another binding behind the main one. Beginners on two skis are usually pulled along at around 25-35 kilometers per hour, whereas more advanced social skiers travel between 40 and 55 kilometers per hour - once confidence is gained it is actually easier to travel faster than at slower speeds because of the greater lift and stability.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>WAKESKATING</h3>
  <div>
  	<img src="./images/cwc10.jpg">
    <p>
    Wake skating is an adaptation of wakeboarding that employs a similar design of board manufactured from plywood or from fiberglass. The fact that the rider is not bound to the board in any way gives wake skating its own unique challenges from wakeboarding. Instead, the top surface of the board is coated in grip tape in a similar fashion to a skateboard or soft, high-traction foam covering that is kinder to riders in the inevitable crashes. Riders usually wear shoes while riding to afford themselves extra purchase on the board, again in the manner of skateboarding.
